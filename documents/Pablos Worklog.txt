Raleway ToDo:
- Swap /q by /q.alt

General ToDo:
- Complete Raleway extension.
- Migrate more project for Nhung (Libre Baskerville, Libre Caslon, Dosis, Cabin, Encode)
- Review Nhung's latest Libre Bodoni pull request.
- Review Nhung's latest Libre Franklin pull request.
- Review Mark’s Dancing Script glyphs migration.

————————————————————————————

Lun 22 August Worklog:
- Finished updating all diacritics to use *comb components
- Finished fixing migration stuff
- New /cedilla design
- Manually add lnum OT features, since Glyphs fails to do it automatically since it can not recognize the default figure style.
- Completed LatinPro expansion

Encoding Questions:
- Superiors and Numerators: 
  Option 1) one.numr & onesuperior
  Option 2) one.numr & one.sups
  The difference is how Glyph will assings unicode values.
  We are including all three options in our encodings (one.numr + onesuperior + one.sups).
  We should pick option1 or option2, and remove eigther onesuperior or one.sups.
  It makes no sense to include them all.
  My vote goes for using Option1, thus removing .sups from “LatinPro Case”

- Subscript and Scientific-Inferiors:
  Option 1) one.subs for both
  Option 2) one.sinf & oneinferior
  We are including all three options in our encodings (one.subs + one.sinf + oneinferior).
  We should pick option1 or option2, and remove the unused. It makes no sense to include them all.
  My vote goes for Option2, thus removing .subs form “LatinPro” and migrating .sinf from “LatinPro Case” to “LatinPro”

Weekend Worklog:

Reviewed, fixed and modernized all anchors in all 3 masters:
- Added missing anchors
- Improved anchors positions
- fixed /ringcomb design
- fixed /ogonek design
- /ogonek detached from _bottom anchor, now attached to _ogonek anchor
- In all diacritics: Unified/Replaced legacy non-comb components by *comb components.
- Removed the “bottomviet” anchors (not longer needed), now we can use the “bottom” instead.
- Added many glyphs from Latin Plus & Platin Pro

- Medium Master design tweaks:
  Sligthly bolder /a bowl and topy
  Sligthly ligther /e crossbar
  Sligthly bolder /z diagonal

- Chat with Mark about an easier way to setup interpolation values in migrated projects, and adding a QA test for “weigthClass” customparameter in instances (so to avoid having 100 and 200 weigth class values).

IMPORTANT TIP FOR UPGRADING SOURCE FILES, LANGUAGE EXTENSION, ETC:
- If the glyphs source file you got does not have *comb diacritics: “DO NOT CREATE NEW *comb GLYPHS”.
  INSTEAD you must “RENAME” the old ones by adding “comb” to the glyph name.
  This way all the glyphs using the component automatically swith to the new *comb version.
  Kerning pairs and kerning classes are automatically updated.
  After renaming, now you can re-create the legacy ones.
IF YOU DONT FOLLOW THIS TIP:
- We end up with a source file having a big nasty mess.
- Some glyphs will be using the legacy components, while other will use the new *comb components.
- The new components will be out of the kerning classes.
- If the legacy diacritics had kerning pairs, the kerning pairs wont be translated into the new ones.
- The legacy diacritics will not be components mirroring the *comb ones
IF YOUR ALREADY CREATED NEW *comb VERSION NOT FOLLOWING THIS TIP:
- Please, at least make sure that they have the share the same sidebearings values, and that the anchors are in the same coordinates.
PLEASE REMEMBER:
Rename legacy diacritics instead of creating new ones. After they have been renamed, recreate the legacy ones.
Never create new *comb diacritics out the blue.

19 August
All these in both roman & italics:
- Updated Glyph info (renamed glyphs according to glyphs naming schema, changed components, etc)
- Fixed a few glyphs interpolation incompatibilities
- Renamed uppercase smallcaps to lowercase smallcaps (H.sc to h.sc)
- Renamed *.lnum to *.lf
- Renamed *.numerator to *.numr
- Renamed *.denominator to *.dnom
- Renamed /NULL to /uni0000
- Renamed /caron.alt to /caroncomb.alt
- Deleted /DZ /Dz /dz /Gacute /gacute /IJ /ij /napostrophe (no longer required)
- Deleted /Delta /Omuga /mu (greek letters replaced by /increment /Ohm /micro)
- Deleted /servicemark
- Recreated OT features
- Recreated stylistic sets for individual glyph control (before is was all or none, now designer can choose what to activate individually)
————————————————————————————

18 August:

Raleway:
The font was not exporting due to a serie of issues
- Fixed “The font contains glyphs with the same unicode” error: /aphostrophe was 2019, changed to 02BC
- Fonlab Kerning Classes where wrongly imported into Glyphs OpenType Classes section, they where removed
- Recreated Kerning Groups
- Recreated Kerning Pairs x3 (once for each master)

At this point, the fonts exported correctly form Glyph, and match almost 100% the originals from v3.000 (except for some minor kerning errors in the interpolated instances. I guess they are due to rounding interpolated values differently.)

Then I did all that again, for the Italics.

And filled a bug in https://github.com/googlei18n/glyphsLib/issues/71

Todo:
- Fix other small migration errors (aringacute, etc..)
- Rename glyphs from FL to Glyphs naming scheme
- Enable automatic alignment and fix whatever is needed
- Complete expansion to GFLatinPro2016

Goal is to have a fully “modernized” and GFLatinPro2016 source for Monday, ready for Alexei to merge the new Cyrillics.
————————————————————————————

16 August:

Goals for Today:
- Review Nhung's latest Libre Franklin pull request.
- Fix Raleway's not imported kerning groups
- Work in Raleway LatinPro extension
- Migrate one more project from FL to Glyph for Nhung
  (Requested: LibreBodoni, Libre Baskerville, Dosis and Cabin)
  I'm guessing these will have similar issues to the Libre Bodoni migration.

Questions:
- What to do with the LibreBodoni migration issues: Spend extra day fixing those now? or Fix later?

————————————————————————————

15 August:

- General catchup:
  Installed latest version of GF 2016 Glyph Sets, Marc Foley’s script, etc…
- Chat with Nhung on LibreFranklin, Raleway, and setuping up glyphs files for next projects
  Raleway: Alexei to merge Nhung Vietnamese into his Cyrillic fork.
  LibreFranklin: I reviewed his latest pull request.
  Nhung’s next projects: She requested Glyphs migrations for Libre Bodoni and Libre Baskerville and Github Projects for Dosis and Cabin.
- Chat with Alexei:
  - Both Mark’s and Alexi’s failed to import the kerning classes, we need to study the problem and fix it.
  - I will continue from Nhung’s files, Alexei will merge his Cyr version later.
- Merged Alexi’s pull request for the Testing Page, adding a Vietnamese paragraph.
- Migrated Libre Bodoni for Nhung, so she can add Vietnamese
  There are some issues.
To do:
- Reviewed Nhung’s latest Libre Franklin pull request
